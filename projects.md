### Monthly Bitcoin Meetup

![](/assets/img/cascadiabitcoinlogo.jpg)

Cascadia Bitcoin is a Bitcoin-specific meetup group I've been working on since early 2022 that focuses on the general Northwest Washington area, though Bitcoiners from anywhere are welcome to atttend. We meet monthly at various breweries to teach and discuss how Bitcoin works, how to use it, best practices, and after a few beers we typically debate its position at a fascinating intersection of economics and philosophy.
